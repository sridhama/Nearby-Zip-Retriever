# Nearby-Zip-Retriever
The Google Maps API does not provide the functionality of extracting nearby zip codes at a particular geo-location. I've devised and implemented an algorithm that fetches the user this data. The implementation uses the Haversine Formula. This algorithm is used at the back-end of BloodSync.com, as we require the list of zip codes in the vicinity.
